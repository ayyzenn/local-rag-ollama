• **Fraud Detection**: Machine learning models detect suspicious patterns in transactions and flag anomalies, significantly reducing fraud and increasing security.

• **Credit Scoring and Risk Assessment**: AI systems use diverse data beyond credit history—such as social behavior and utility payment history—to evaluate borrower risk, enabling financial inclusion.

• **Robo‑Advisors**: Automated investment platforms use AI to deliver portfolio planning and asset allocation based on client goals, risk appetite, and market trends.

• **Customer Support**: Financial institutions deploy chatbots for account queries, balance checks, and fraud reporting, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction.

• **RegTech & Compliance**: AI assists in interpreting regulation, scanning documents, and ensuring compliance—streamlining operations and reducing penalties.

• **Predictive Analytics**: Banks use AI to forecast customer churn, loan default likelihood, and economic trends—enabling proactive strategies.
