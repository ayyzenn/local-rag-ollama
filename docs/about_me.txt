**Name:** Saad Ahmad
**Location:** DIKhan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan

## Bio
I am a passionate learner and practitioner focused on building AI agents and intelligent systems. I have completed foundational topics like Generative AI and LLM basics and am currently diving into Prompt Engineering. I leverage Ollama and local LLMs, and I'm building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline running entirely offline on my machine. I have hands-on skills in Python, ChromaDB, sentence-transformer embeddings, and command-line interfacing via subprocess.

## Interests and Goals
- Deepening agentic AI workflows: integrating memory, tool use, multi-step reasoning, and deployment
- Enhancing pre-processing, vector DBs, and memory strategies  
- Building production-ready AI agents that can plug into environments like Slack, Gmail, filesystems
- Optimizing for performance, cost, and safety
- Sharing knowledge, documenting workflows, and helping others adopt these tools

## Technical Skills and Tools
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Local LLM:** Ollama + llama3.1 (local LLM)
- **Vector Database:** ChromaDB (vector store)
- **Embeddings:** sentence-transformers ("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
- **Planned Integrations:** LangChain (future integration)
- **Operating System:** Linux/Unix command line

## Current Learning Journey
- âœ… **Completed:** Topics 1 & 2 (GenAI intro and LLM basics)
- ðŸ”„ **Currently Working On:** Prompt Engineering and LLM Parameters
- ðŸš§ **In Progress:** Constructing a RAG system with my own documents
- ðŸŽ¯ **Next on Roadmap:** Vector Databases (Topic 7) and beyond

## Project Focus
I am currently building a local RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that operates entirely offline, using my personal knowledge base to answer questions about AI applications in various domains including education, finance, and healthcare.
